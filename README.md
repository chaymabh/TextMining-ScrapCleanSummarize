# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Text Summarization with NLTK

This repository contains a code that performs a complete web scraping process, from accessing a website to transforming its data into summarized texts and CSV files. The code focuses on scraping data from the "ISTIC" website, which belongs to my university.

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Automated data scraping: It extracts specific data from the website using the Beautiful Soup library.
2. Conversion to CSV files: It transforms the extracted data, particularly tables, into CSV files using the Pandas library.
3. Text summarization: It summarizes paragraphs using the NLTK library, providing condensed versions of the text content.
4. Automated image scraping: It extracts images from the website and saves them in a designated folder.

This code provides a comprehensive process for scraping data, transforming it, and extracting valuable information from websites. By customizing the code to suit your needs, you can apply it to different websites and extract specific data of interest.

Feel free to explore and modify this code to fit your requirements. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.
